# Description

AmxxCurl module is a wrapper over libcurl easy interface for amxmodx. Module performs curl's in non-blocking mode.

Download latest version [here](https://github.com/Polarhigh/AmxxCurl/releases).

## Remarks for installation Linux version

This module dynamically linked with openssl, and therefore if it asent in system you'll get load failure.

And therefore:

-   You must have installed metamod plugin [SoLoader](https://github.com/Polarhigh/SoLoader/releases) (and it must be written on top addons/metamod/plugins.ini);
-   And then add lines in addons/soloader/libraries.cfg:


```
libcrypto.so.1.0.0
libssl.so.1.0.0
```

# Compilation

You must have installed the latest version premake5. ([Get it here](https://github.com/premake/premake-core))

**IMPORTANT**: You need to compile premake5 from git sources, because premake-5.0.0-alpha9 not support some options (_linkgroups_ and _symbols_, if you do not wont to compile it under windows, just comment line 70 (`linkgroups "On"`) and replace `symbols "On"` to `flags {"Symbols"}` on line 27 in premake5.lua)

## Windows

First, set the environment variables HLSDK and METAMOD.

Then, generate Visual Studio project:

    premake5 vs2015

_You may try generate project for another Visual Studio version, but only vs2015 was tested._

Now open solution and compile it)

## Linux

First, set the environment variables:

    export HLSDK=~/path_to/halflife
    export METAMOD=~/path_to/metamod-hl1/metamod

Then, call premake5 for generate Makefile:

    premake5 gmake

And now compile:

    cd build/gmake
    make

# Natives

All natives functions you can find in [curl.inc](https://github.com/Polarhigh/AmxxCurl/blob/master/amx_includes/curl.inc), they have the same behaviour that [C functions](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/).

Except for some:

1)

    native void:curl_easy_perform(const CURL:handle, const callbackComplite[], const data[] = {}, const data_len = 0)

The function starts executing in new thread, after, callbackComplite will be called. The third and fourth parameters set the addition data that will be sent in the third argument complete callback:
`public compliteCallback(CURL:curl, CURLcode:code, data[])`

2)

    native CURLcode:curl_easy_getinfo(const CURL:handle, const CURLINFO:info, any:...)

For string type of CURLINFO option, you must set fourth argument - string size:

    new url[64]
    curl_easy_getinfo(curl,CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_URL, url, charsmax(url))
